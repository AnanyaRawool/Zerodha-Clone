package.json - importat file . additional packages, npm package,node manager package detiails get here .frontend consist of node_modules folder.
by using package.json we can recreate node module folder
on github we dont have node module folder as it is too big so we have to install it we have to install node module so (npm i) by this it will go package.json and read all the pakages with its version and download all these using npm.

package-lock.json it track dependencies of packages so for dependencies requried packages .
track packages which are external for our package  i.e packages for dependencies 
In the package.json we should not make changes in the file 
as we modify package.json chages are done by system in the package-lock.

gitignore:consist local environmant variable

manifest.json : it track thing which are store in the cash-memory.
when we load a website 1st time it will take time but when we load same website it will load in less time,the reason behind this is when we load a webside 1st time we store some things in the browser's cash-memory 
the listing of these stored things in done in the manifest 
due to this project loading time will become less which is good.

robot.txt:very important for search engine optimization.
this is the which is read 1st by search engine.
on the basis of instruction in this file our wesite is get croll.
crolling is the process by whcih seach engine get to know that what things are included in our website that can be meta tag, key words service based or product based .
when we register domain automatically croll appear or we can request manual croll (in google -> setting ->business setting-> request manual croll) so our website get crolled
so here for crolling we have to disallow something like admin section or any hidden route which we dont want to show public these things we can write in the disallow section of robots.txt file.
eg:
Disallow:
admin/
so croller will not visit to admin

reportWebVitals.js: it consist some stacks or data whcih is collected by browser
it is default in react application
we will track when someone open app, boarding time, click options are tracked in this file
now we dont want it so deleting it.
 code of it is :
 const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {
   if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {
     import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {
       getCLS(onPerfEntry);
       getFID(onPerfEntry);
       getFCP(onPerfEntry);
       getLCP(onPerfEntry);
       getTTFB(onPerfEntry);
     });
   }
 };
 export default reportWebVitals;

note: always when starting project go in folder in which we wring project like frontend folder and do (git init)
1. git init
2. git add .                            ....it will go to modified phase of github
3. git commit -m "Initial Setup"
4. git checkout -b project-structure     ....for creating new branch & go to newer branch
this should be done after  every stage of completion so work is saved step by step


install extention simple react snippets use for shortcut in react codeing like "imr + tab button = import React from 'react'; " 
"npm start" to run project

note: if we copy code from booetstrap and other tehn we hve to format it so , right click -> format document -> configure -> select prittier configuration

react router is need to install for when we click on about need to route on on about page . "npm i react-router-dom"

<a> tag use for external link
 mr-5  margin right
 ml margin left 
 mx margin left and right 
 my margin top and buttom

it we want ot add our own sty;ing by css file in the index.html so add it after bootstrap .


all about dashboard
left vertical(watch list) bar show stocks , 9/50 mean 9 are favourite stock and capacity is 50
green coloured name:stock price is increasing ,it is profit  
red coloured name: stock price is decreasing 
right side is summary that we have
equity:how much we have fund to spend to purchase stock
holding : currently what price of stock we have also show our investment in big box number we see under holding title show profit if number in green if in red the nit is loss according to our total purchased stoked that is based on all data
in 'order' section we track buy and sell of stock , but it not decide profit and loss
in 'holding' section we track profit loss with detail table format
position: we have to sell stock on a certain threshold(purchase stocked in 100 & we set lower limit like , if it go 90 sell it automatically as we facing loss)
funds: in 'add fund' we take funds from user so user can invest more money. 
       in 'withdraw',money  by which user not purchased stock after selling stocks that can be withdraw
last icon is of user portal here only logout will work

on button of 'buy or sell' we get popup that ask which stock you want ot purchase with which amount

as bootstrap we hane material ui but it is specially for react

Backend : 
npm init
npm i -D nodemon  here we downloading developer dependencies
npm i express body-parser cors dotenv mongoose passport  passport-local  passport-local-mongoose
body-parser: help to work with data which is being get to and fro by API
cross origin resourse sharing (CORS): as our react application on different place and our backend is on another url between bot to establish communication we use cors with enhance security
dotenv: database url and credencial will get hidded so not visible publicly , it get hide on git ignore as all files are hidden
mongoose: it is package or depnencies which is use to connect database & all database realted task
passport : it help in the authentication and in login, signup
passport-local : it requried for passport
 passport-local-mongoose: It is mongodb support package
to run backend index.js :' nodemon index.js' or npm start, for dashboard run nodemon index.js
.env : is hidden file , this file is local not public consist of mongodburl 
mongodb wesite -> connect -> drivers -> copy url 
 in copied url : mongodb+srv://ananyarawool1004_mongodb:<db_password>@zerodhaclonecluster.1ekuvnx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=....Zerodha....CloneCluster
  in url section ....anyname.... is a connection name

database
 our database name is default ' test' in which we have holding data
thunder client is the extension that is we use in place of postman
 in thunder client 1st check server is runnign on the terminal or not and then send request by placeing url of that request on the field 
refresh on the database section of the mongodb so it appear under test section 
npm i axios in frontend folder to connect to the 

context is piece of item whihc share components , it will effect cmoponent like buy popup by clicking on buy button 

testing project
after makeing changes in project,earlier featuers(feature mean uploaded image in the page is apprearing or not) are working smoothly or not  is called testing 
2 types: manual, automated testing 
in automation testing we write scripts which run in backend by browser to make sure that feature are running as expected , so no need to again and again test manually
 it important that aleast one time manually testing will performed and then automatically
script written for automated testing use a framework named as jest-dom
jest-dom is pre-installed library present in the package.json   
go to website jestjs.io
extention is test.js
